You can test the application with the index.html file.
It is possible to write something to the search field.
I used AngularJS.
The file that contains the module and the controller is the app.js file.
I used Bower for package management.
I used Bootstrap and SASS to design the page.
I used Grunt and SASS.
I created some unit testing using Jasmine and Karma.
The file for unit testing is in test/unit folder. It called testApp.js.
